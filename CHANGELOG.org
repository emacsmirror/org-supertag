* Changelog

* [2.2.0] - 2025-01-25
** Features
**** Add automatic node creation for org headlines
- Add ~org-supertag-sync-auto-create-node~ to control auto creation
- Add ~org-supertag-sync-node-creation-level~ for minimum level
- Modify ~org-supertag-db-update-buffer~ to handle auto creation

This change enables automatic conversion of org headlines to nodes
during synchronization, making node creation more seamless while
maintaining control through customization options.

  - ~org-supertag-sync-remove-directory~
  - ~org-supertag-sync-list-directories~

*** Improve 
**** File organization
- Move org-supertag-sync-state.el to org-supertag-data-directory

* [2.0.0] - 2025-01-13

** Features
*** Behavior: Added schedule trigger and deadline management system
**** Implemented cron-style scheduling for behaviors
- Format: "minute hour day month weekday"
- Examples:
  - "0 9 * * 1-5" (weekdays at 9:00)
  - "30 * * * *" (every hour at :30)
  - "0 0 1 * *" (first day of each month)
**** Added native org-mode timestamp integration
- Support for SCHEDULED and DEADLINE timestamps
- Support for absolute timestamps (<2024-03-20 Wed>)
- Support for relative time expressions (now+2h, now-1d)
- Support for property-based timing (${prop:DEADLINE}-2h)
**** Added deadline check behavior (@deadline-check)
**** Added derived behaviors for deadline management:
- @overdue-urgent: Set high priority for overdue tasks
- @upcoming-deadline: Mark tasks due in next 3 days
- @overdue-archive: Archive overdue completed tasks

*** Field: Enhanced timestamp handling
- Improved org-mode timestamp format support
- Date fields now use active timestamps (<...>) for agenda visibility
- Timestamp fields use inactive timestamps ([...]) for historical records
- Added automatic format conversion between different timestamp styles

*** Behavior Template: Added template variable system for behaviors
**** Added support for dynamic variable expansion
- ${input:prompt} for user input
- ${date:format} for date operations
- ${prop:name} for property access
- ${context:key} for shared data
**** Added conditional execution with {if:condition}
**** Added relative date calculations (now+1d, now-1w)
**** Added simple context object for data sharing

*** Node Management: Added new node operations
- Added ~org-supertag-move-node-and-link~ command for node relocation with reference
- Added ~org-supertag-delete-node~ command for complete node cleanup
- Added flexible node movement behaviors
- Support for keeping links at original location
- Interactive target selection

*** Sync: Added automatic synchronization system
- Added file state tracking
- Added buffer modification monitoring
- Added automatic sync with conflict detection
- Added state persistence and error recovery

*** Tag: Added improved tag change functionality

*** Performance: Added asynchronous face refresh mechanism

** Bug Fixes
*** Fixed tag prefix matching issues (#9)
- Improved tag completion with custom completion function
- Added TAB completion support
*** Fixed field type options insertion
*** Fixed behavior system event handling
*** Improved error handling in node operations
*** Enhanced synchronization stability

* Introduction

Org-supertag is a package that enhances org-mode's tag functionality. It enables tags to not only set properties for nodes, but also directly manipulate nodes and automatically execute certain behaviors based on time, providing a more flexible way of information management.

Org-supertag offers high degrees of freedom, flexibility, and convenience. Through it, you can customize your own behaviors to achieve more complex functionalities - its potential is essentially limitless.

Org-supertag adopts a non-intrusive design, coexisting harmoniously with org-mode's original features while providing more possibilities.

* Features

** Feature Overview

- Enhanced Tag Functionality
    - Set properties for org-headlines, add multiple org-properties at once and batch fill corresponding values
    - Transform regular org-headlines into searchable and referenceable nodes
    - Add behaviors to tags that can complete multiple operations at once
- Convenient Search Functionality
    - Search with multiple keywords at once (using AND logic)
    - Beautified search results page showing both titles and content beneath
    - Multiple search result export methods for easy organization
      - Export search results to another file
      - Export search results to a new file (location and filename customizable)
      - Export search results directly to current cursor position
- Automatic Synchronization
    - Automatically sync position and changes of org-headlines converted to Nodes, saving manual operations
    - Provides manual command to sync all Nodes
- Integrated Behavior System for Automation
    - Behavior system makes tags "smart", automatically triggering preset actions when adding/removing tags (like changing styles, setting states, etc.)
    - One tag can trigger multiple actions, e.g., adding @urgent tag can simultaneously "turn red", "set priority", "add deadline", etc.
    - Behaviors can be scheduled, combined, and parameterized, making your org-mode workflow more automated and efficient
    - Behavior system includes a behavior library - you can use predefined common behaviors or create your own custom ones. This modular design makes behaviors easily shareable, reusable, and extensible between different org files or users
    - Customizable Behavior Commands
      + Simple configuration syntax
      + Parameterized configuration
      + Can combine multiple Behaviors together

** Enhanced Tag System
Make your org-mode tags powerful metadata controllers:

*** Adding Tags/Setting Properties
- Set multiple properties at once when adding tags
- Batch fill property values
- Type validation for property values

[[./picture/figure4.gif][M-x org-supertag-tag-add-tag]]

Two commands involved:

~M-x org-supertag-tag-add-tag~
~M-x org-supertag-tag-set-field-and-value~

*** Node System
- Automatic node creation, no manual creation needed
- Establish reference relationships between nodes

[[./picture/figure5.gif][M-x org-supertag-node-add-reference]]

If a node isn't automatically created, you can directly run ~M-x org-supertag-node-create~ command to convert the current heading into a node.

*** Behavior System
Make tags "smart", enabling:
- Trigger actions when adding/removing tags
- Combine multiple actions into workflows
- Set scheduled behaviors
- Customize tag styles

[[./picture/figure6.gif][M-x org-supertag-behavior-attach]]

Two commands involved:

~M-x org-supertag-behavior-attach~
~M-x org-supertag-behavior-detach~

** Powerful Search
Efficiently find and organize your nodes:

*** Multi-keyword Search
- Support multiple keyword combination search (AND logic)
- Aesthetic search results interface
- Preview content under headings

[[./picture/figure8.gif][M-x org-supertag-query]]

*** Flexible Export Options
Multiple ways to organize search results:
- Export to existing files
- Create new files to save results
- Insert at current position

[[./picture/figure9.gif]]

** Automatic Synchronization
Automatically maintain node organization:
- Track node position changes
- Automatically update reference relationships
- Provide manual sync commands

[[./picture/figure7.gif][M-x org-supertag-sync-force-all]]

If some nodes need synchronization but haven't auto-synced, you can directly run ~M-x org-supertag-sync-force-all~ command to sync all node information to the database.

* Basic Usage

** Adding Tags

#+begin_src
M-x org-supertag-tag-add-tag
#+end_src

Add tags to current heading, can set properties simultaneously.

** Creating References
#+begin_src
M-x org-supertag-node-add-reference
#+end_src

Add references to other nodes.

** Searching
#+begin_src
M-x org-supertag-query
#+end_src

Search nodes using multiple keywords.

** Adding Behaviors
#+begin_src
M-x org-supertag-behavior-attach
#+end_src

Attach automated behaviors to tags.

* Basic Installation

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package org-supertag
  :straight (:host github :repo "yibie/org-supertag")
  :after org
  :config
  (org-supertag-setup))
#+end_src

* Advanced Usage

** Behavior System Configuration
Create custom behaviors by editing ~/.emacs.d/org-supertag/org-supertag-custom-behavior.el file:

Here's an example

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Register a behavior named "@urgent"
;; Parameter explanation:
;;   - @urgent: behavior name, used to identify and reference this behavior
;;   - :trigger: trigger condition, :on-add means trigger when adding tag
;;   - :list: list of actions to execute, each action is a command string
;;   - :style: tag display style, including font and prefix icon settings
(org-supertag-behavior-register "@urgent"                 <= Register a behavior named "@urgent"
  :trigger :on-add                                        <= Trigger when adding tag
  :list '("@todo=TODO"                                    <= Set TODO state
         "@priority=A"                                    <= Set priority to A
         "@deadline=today")                               <= Set deadline to today
  :style '(:face (:foreground "red" :weight bold)         <= Set tag display to red and bold
          :prefix "🔥"))                                  <= Show fire icon before tag
#+end_src

* Future Plans

- ✅ Provide more query scopes, like querying against one or multiple files
- ✅ Initially implement a command system where tags automatically trigger commands, e.g., when a node is tagged as Task, it automatically sets TODO, priority A, and changes node background to yellow
- ✅ Implement a task scheduling system to combine multiple nodes for completing a series of tasks, e.g., automatically setting daily review at 9 PM and automatically inserting review results into review nodes (experimental feature, may not be implemented)
- AI integration, different tags associated with different Prompts, e.g., when a node is marked as "task", automatically trigger AI commands to generate a task list
- Like Tana, provide more views (experimental feature, may not be implemented)
